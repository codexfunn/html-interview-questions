# üß± Semantic, Structural, and Formatting Tags in HTML

---

## üß† What Are Semantic Tags?

**Semantic HTML** means using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning ‚Äî both to the browser **and** developers.

> Example: `<article>` is semantic, `<div>` is not.

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* Improves **SEO** and **accessibility**
* Makes code **easier to read & maintain**
* Helps screen readers and search engines understand your content better

### üîπ Common Semantic Tags:

| Tag         | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<header>`  | Defines a page or section header  |
| `<nav>`     | Navigation links                  |
| `<main>`    | Main content of the page          |
| `<article>` | Independent, self-contained block |
| `<section>` | Group of related content          |
| `<aside>`   | Sidebar / related content         |
| `<footer>`  | Bottom/footer of section/page     |

## üß± What is Structure in HTML?

The **structure** of an HTML page refers to how content is **logically organized** from top to bottom.

### üîπ Basic Structure Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>Site Header</header>
    <nav>Navigation Bar</nav>
    <main>
      <section>
        <article>
          <h1>Blog Post Title</h1>
          <p>Post content...</p>
        </article>
      </section>
    </main>
    <footer>Site Footer</footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

This structure helps browsers, search engines, and devs understand the **hierarchy** of content.

## ‚úçÔ∏è What Are Formatting Tags?

Formatting tags are used to **style text content** in a simple way (inline level, not layout-based).

### üîπ Common Formatting Tags:

| Tag        | Use                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `<b>`      | Bold text (without importance)   |
| `<strong>` | Important bold text              |
| `<i>`      | Italic text (no emphasis)        |
| `<em>`     | Emphasized text                  |
| `<u>`      | Underlined text                  |
| `<mark>`   | Highlighted text                 |
| `<sup>`    | Superscript                      |
| `<sub>`    | Subscript                        |
| `<br>`     | Line break                       |
| `<hr>`     | Horizontal rule (thematic break) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid overusing formatting tags for design ‚Äî use **CSS** for that instead.
